\title{Get DNA model-based estimates from an MpraObject (the expected values based
on the model). These can be compared with the observed counts to assess
goodness of fit.}
\usage{
getFits_DNA(
  obj,
  enhancers = NULL,
  depth = TRUE,
  full = TRUE,
  transition = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{MpraObject to extract from}

\item{enhancers}{which enhancers to get the fits for. Can be character
vectors with enhancer names, logical or numeric enhancer indices, or NULL if
all enhancers are to be extracted (default)}

\item{depth}{include depth correction in the model fitting (default TRUE)}

\item{full}{if LRT modeling was used, TRUE (default) would return the fits
of the full model, FALSEwould return the reduced model fits.}

\item{transition}{use the DNA->RNA transition matrix (deafult: FALSE). This
is useful if the DNA observations need to be distributed to match the RNA
observations.}
}
\value{
DNA fits (numeric, enhancers x samples)
}
