\title{Get RNA model-based estimates from an MpraObject (the expected values based
on the model). These can be compared with the observed counts to assess
goodness of fit.}
\usage{
getFits_RNA(obj, enhancers = NULL, depth = TRUE, full = TRUE, rnascale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{MpraObject to extract from}

\item{enhancers}{which enhancers to get the fits for. Can be character
vectors with enhancer names, logical or numeric enhancer indices, or NULL if
all enhancers are to be extracted (default)}

\item{depth}{include depth correction in the model fitting (default TRUE)}

\item{full}{if LRT modeling was used, TRUE (default) would return the fits
of the full model, FALSEwould return the reduced model fits.}

\item{rnascale}{if controls were used to correct the fitting (in comparative
analyses), use these factors to re-adjust the estimates back.}
}
\value{
RNA fits (numeric, enhancers x samples)
}
